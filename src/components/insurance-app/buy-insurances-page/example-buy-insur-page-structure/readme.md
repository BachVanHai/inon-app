Hello everyone who is reading my nonsense.
This is just an example folder to help dev create buy-insurance feature more quickly so you can consider it is some kind of dummy folder since it doesn't doing anything effect to the project's logic itself 
(please don't import any components of this folder to your js files, they're all useless by the way).
So how to use "example-buy-insur-page-structure" folder effectively? 
Well, all you need to do is just copy this folder and paste it into "buy-insurances" folder,
rename it to whatever name you want, resolve some import's paths confilct in "views" and "component" folder and then it will be definitely good to go. 
Have a great day!
